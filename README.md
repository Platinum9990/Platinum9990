I'm a computer science student with a strong interest in data analytics, machine learning, and electronics. I'm excited about the potential of these fields to solve real-world problems and drive innovation.

My current focus is on:

Data analytics: Proficiency in Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
Machine learning: Understanding of key algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks) and their applications.
Electronics: Basic knowledge of circuit components, breadboarding, and programming microcontrollers.
I'm actively seeking opportunities to:
Join projects that align with my interests
Contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a collaborative team
Learn from experienced professionals
